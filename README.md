# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction – EDA & Data Preprocessing Pipeline

A beginner-to-intermediate-friendly project that walks you through the **entire journey of preparing data** for customer churn prediction — one notebook at a time. 🧪


🚀 **This repo is updated weekly** with:
- Clean, progressive Jupyter notebooks
- Raw & processed datasets
- Practical examples using Python & pandas
- Real-world-style applied EDA for churn modeling

## 🧭 What's Inside?

This project covers the **complete preprocessing & EDA pipeline**, built step-by-step:

| Notebook                         | Description                                                                                                           |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `0_handle_missing_values.ipynb`  | Identify & handle missing values using LLM                                                                            |
| `1_handle_outliers.ipynb`        | Detect & treat outliers                                                                                               |
| `2_feature_binning.ipynb`        | Continuous numerical features are grouped into discrete bins or intervals                                             |
| `3_feature_encoding.ipynb`       | Converting categorical or text data into a numerical format that machine learning models can understand and utilize   | 
| `4_feature_scaling.ipynb`        | Data preprocessing technique used to standardize or Normalize the range of independent variables or features of data  |
